# Predicting-Survival-on-the-Titanic
In this data science project, we aim to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the ill-fated voyage of the Titanic. The dataset includes various features such as PassengerID, Passenger Class (Pclass), Name, Sex, Age, Sibling/Spouse Count (SibSp), Parent/Child Count (Parch), Ticket number, Fare, Cabin number, and Port of Embarkation. The main objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster (Survived: 0 = No; 1 = Yes) based on the available data. We will explore and preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and apply machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can accurately classify passengers into survival categories. This project offers insights into the factors that contributed to survival during this historic event and showcases the power of data science in understanding historical events.
